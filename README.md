## FAQ

**Can AI chatbots really replace human customer service agents?**
AI agents handle 60-80% of routine inquiries including FAQs, order status, and simple troubleshooting, freeing human agents for complex emotional situations requiring empathy. Platforms like Gorgias achieve 60% automated resolution while maintaining brand-aligned conversations. However, human oversight remains essential for nuanced problems, complaints requiring judgment, and building customer relationships where emotional intelligence matters. Best practice combines AI handling routine volume with seamless human escalation for complex cases.

**How long does it take to deploy an AI customer service chatbot?**
No-code platforms like BurstyAI, Tidio, and Wonderchat enable deploying functional chatbots within hours by uploading documents and website content for automatic training. Enterprise platforms like Yellow.ai achieve 2× faster deployment than traditional implementations though still require weeks for complex workflows. Simple FAQ bots go live same-day while sophisticated agents handling transactions, database queries, and multi-step workflows need 1-2 weeks for testing and integration. Ongoing optimization continues indefinitely as you refine responses based on real conversations.

**What's the difference between rule-based chatbots and AI agents?**
Rule-based chatbots follow predetermined conversation trees responding only to specific keywords and button clicks, breaking when users deviate from expected paths. AI agents powered by large language models understand natural language intent, maintain context across conversations, and generate human-like responses to unpredictable questions. Modern AI agents also execute actions like database queries, bookings, and API calls versus simply providing information. Choose rule-based for extremely predictable workflows and AI agents for flexible natural conversations.
